This project aims to analyze and visualize restaurant data from Pune, India, in light of the city's growing restaurant industry. Evaluating various parameters such as ratings, reviews, cuisines, and services is essential for understanding customer preferences and providing insights into restaurant performance. The dataset includes information about prominent restaurants in Pune, each offering unique dining experiences characterized by cuisine variety, customer ratings, and services. By exploring this data, we seek to identify trends in customer satisfaction, preferences, and overall restaurant performance.

The main objectives of this project are:
* To analyze and compare the performance of selected restaurants based on their customer ratings, reviews, and votes.
* To assess the services provided by these restaurants, including facilities such as parking, live music, Wi-Fi, and alcohol availability.

                                       Challenges

* Subjective Ratings: Customer ratings and reviews are subjective, and while they provide useful insights, they may be influenced by individual preferences and biases.
* Service Comparisons: Not all services are equally comparable across restaurants, and some features (e.g., live music, home delivery) may not be available at all restaurants, which can limit direct comparisons.
* Missing Data: Some service features like Wi-Fi or free parking may not be applicable to all restaurants, which can skew the analysis if not accounted for.


                                        Final Report
